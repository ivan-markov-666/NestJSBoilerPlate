## What was done in that lecture:  
Added validation that the ID exists in the JSON file.  

### Added to the project:  
1. Edited the 'example.controller.ts' file. See the file for more details.  
2. Start the server.  
3. Test the new code. You can test it from './example.http' file. Or you can test by executing the following cURL commands:  

> curl -i http://localhost:3000/example/5831231231232134234234  

Check the server's console for the response. Now the response should be "404 Not Found".
